# 3d

Pure Lua 3D lib for norns.

Based on an [example code](https://gist.github.com/Ivoah/477775d13e142b2c89ba) by [@Ivoah](https://github.com/Ivoah) for [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).

## Description

Provides classes for storing & manipulating 3D objects, with similar APIs but different internal structures:

 - [Polyhedron](./lib/3d/polyhedron.lua)
 - [Wireframe](./lib/3d/wireframe.lua)
 - [Sphere](./lib/3d/sphere.lua)

`Polyhedron` has a notion of faces composed of vertices. It is more suited for importing 3D models.

`Wireframe`, on the other hand, only has a notion of edges (line between points). It is more suited for representing models with internal edges (such as an hypercube).

Both support importing `.OBJ` models (even though `Polyhedron` is more naturally suited for this use-case).

`Sphere` is just a basic sphere.


## Usage

#### Basic

Importing a 3D model and displaying it.

```lua
local Polyhedron = include('lib/3d/polyhedron')
local draw_mode = include('lib/3d/enums/draw_mode')

local model = Polyhedron.new_from_obj("/home/we/dust/code/3d/model/teapot.obj")
local level = 15
model:draw(level, draw_mode.FACES)
```

Rotating it:

```lua
local axis = include('lib/3d/enums/axis')

model:rotate(axis.Y, 0.02)
```

Drawing can take a multiplication coefficient and a camera position:

```lua
local mult = 64        -- scale up model by 640%
local cam = {0, 0, -4} -- camera coordinates (x, y, z)
model:draw(level, draw_mode.FACES, mult, cam)
```

This is important as `.OBJ` models vary greatly in scale and are not necessarily origin-centered.

See the [teapot](./obj_teapot.lua) (`Polyhedron`) and [wireframe_cube](./wireframe_cube.lua) (`Wireframe`) examples for this basic use-case.


#### Drawing modes

Several draw mode are supported:

```lua
model:draw(nil,   draw_mode.FACES)     -- faces (not supported by `Wireframe`)
model:draw(level, draw_mode.WIREFRAME) -- edges
model:draw(level, draw_mode.POINTS)    -- vertices
```

And can be combined:

```lua
model:draw(level, draw_mode.FACES | draw_mode.WIREFRAME) -- faces + edges
```

In this case, independant levels can be specified:

```lua
model:draw(level, draw_mode.WIREFRAME | draw_mode.POINTS, nil, nil,
           {line_level = 10,
            point_level = 5})
```

See the [octagon](./obj_octagon.lua) example to illustrate this use-case.


#### Custom drawing function

A custom drawing function can be configured:

```lua
function draw_v_as_circle(x, y, l)
  if l then
    screen.level(l)
  end
  local radius = 2
  screen.move(x + radius, y)
  screen.circle(x, y, radius)
  screen.fill()
end

model:draw(level, draw_mode.POINTS, mult, cam,
           {point_draw_fn = draw_v_as_circle})
```

Custom drawing function parameter depends of `draw_mode`:

| object \ draw_mode | `POINTS`                 | `WIREFRAME`                        | `FACES`                    |
| ---                | ---                      | ---                                | ---                        |
| `Wireframe`        | `point_draw_fn(x, y, l)` | `lines_draw_fn(x0, y0, x1, y1, l)` | n/a                        |
| `Polyhedron`       | `point_draw_fn(x, y, l)` | `face_edges_draw_fn(f_edges, l)`   | `face_draw_fn(f_edges, l)` |


See the [octagon](./obj_octagon.lua) example to illustrate this use-case.


#### Conditional drawing

Drawing of vertices/edges/faces can be conditional thanks to these props:

| prop       | description                                            |
| ---        | ---                                                    |
| `draw_pct` | % of chance that element get drawn                     |
| `min_z`    | elements w/ at least 1 vertex bellow value are skipped |
| `maw_z`    | elements w/ at least 1 vertex above value are skipped |

When tuned appropriately, this can lead to a nice glitchy effect.

#### Glitchy elements

`Wireframe`, when in `draw_mode.WIREFRAME`, supports drawing random lines between vertices.

| prop                     | description                                      |
| ---                      | ---                                              |
| `glitch_edge_pct`        | % of chance that element get drawn               |
| `glitch_edge_amount_pct` | % of total vertices that attempts getting linked |

See the [glitchpercube](./obj_glitchpercube.lua) example.
